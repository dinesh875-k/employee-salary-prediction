ðŸ’¸ðŸ’°Employee Salary Prediction is a machine learning-based application that estimates the expected salary of an employee based on their age, years of experience, and gender. The goal is to provide companies or individuals with an intelligent tool to make data-driven decisions regarding compensation.

Sure! Here are the **steps only** for building the Employee Salary Prediction App:

Steps to Build Employee Salary Prediction App

1. Prepare Dataset

   * Ensure the dataset contains: `Experience_Years`, `Age`, `Gender`, and `Salary`.

2. Preprocess Data

   * Encode categorical variables (e.g., convert Gender to numeric).
   * Drop unnecessary columns (e.g., `ID` if present).

3. Train Machine Learning Model

   * Use a regression algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression).
   * Train the model on features: `Experience_Years`, `Age`, `Gender`.
   * Save the trained model using `joblib`.

4. Install Required Libraries

   pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn joblib

5. Create Streamlit App (`app.py`)

   * Load the trained model.
   * Create UI elements to collect user input (age, experience, gender).
   * Convert inputs into a DataFrame and predict salary.
   * Add UI effects like `st.balloons()`, `st.snow()`, and GIFs for fun feedback.

6. Set Background Image (Optional)

   * Convert image to base64 and inject via `st.markdown` + custom CSS.

7. Run App Locally

   streamlit run app.py
   
8. Push to GitHub

   * Include `app.py`, `salary_model.pkl`, `requirements.txt`, and `README.md`.

9. (Optional) Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

   * Link GitHub repo on [https://share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   * Set the app entry file and requirements.
